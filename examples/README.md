All KGs were generated from the abstracts of scientific papers.

Each subdirectory (e.g. '00') contains the following artifacts:

reference.txt..........................information on the abstract's paper

abs.txt...............................a plain-text version of the abstract

abs_preprocessed.txt.............................the preprocessed abstract

abs_preprocessed_triples.txt................a set of RDF triples extracted

abs_preprocessed_links.txt.....................the ontology links obtained

abs_preprocessed_kg.ttl.........a RDF representation of the graph (turtle)

abs_preprocessed_kg.png...............an image representation of the graph
