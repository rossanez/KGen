Variants in the triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 have been associated with increased risk for sporadic, late-onset Alzheimer's disease.
Here we show that germline knockout of Trem2 or the TREM2R47H variant reduces microgliosis around amyloid-beta plaques and facilitates the seeding and spreading of neuritic plaque tau aggregates.
These findings demonstrate a key role for TREM2 and microglia in limiting the development of peri-plaque tau pathologies.
