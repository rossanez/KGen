Ensuring that ontologies are consistent is an important part of ontology development and testing.
This is especially important when autonomous software agents are to use ontologies in autonomous software agents reasoning.
Reasoning with inconsistent ontologies may lead to erroneous conclusions.
In this paper we introduce the ConsVISor tool for consistency checking of ontologies.
the ConsVISor tool is a consistency checker.
the ConsVISor tool is the more recent ontology languages.
the ConsVISor tool is both traditional data modeling languages.
ConsVISor checks consistency by verifying axioms.
the UBOT toolkit that uses a variety of techniques such as theorem proving.
the UBOT toolkit that uses a variety of techniques such as logic programming.
ConsVISor is part of the UBOT toolkit.
Some examples of the use of these tools are given.
