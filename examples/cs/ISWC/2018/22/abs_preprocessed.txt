In the absence of a central naming authority on the Semantic Web, it is common for different datasets to refer to the same thing by different IRIs.
Whenever multiple names are used to denote the same thing, owl: sameAs statements are needed in order to link the data and foster reuse.
Studies that date back as far as 2009, have observed that the owl: sameAs property is sometimes used incorrectly.
In this paper, we show how network metrics such as the community structure of the owl: sameAs property: sameAs graph can be used in order to detect such possibly erroneous statements.
One benefit of the here presented approach is that the here presented approach can be applied to the network of owl: sameAs does not rely on any additional knowledge.
One benefit of the here presented approach is that the here presented approach can be applied to the network of owl: sameAs links the here presented approach.
In order to illustrate the here presented approach ability to scale, the approach is evaluated on the largest collection of identity links to date, containing over 558M owl: sameAs links scraped from the LOD Cloud.
