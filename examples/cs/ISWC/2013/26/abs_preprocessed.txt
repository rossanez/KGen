Combining structured queries with full-text search provides a powerful means to access.
access distributed linked data.
However, executing hybrid search queries in a federation of multiple data sources presents a number of challenges due to data source heterogeneity and lack of statistical data about keyword selectivity.
To address these challenges, we present FedSearch– a novel hybrid query engine based on the SPARQL federation framework FedX.
We extend the SPARQL algebra to incorporate keyword search clauses as first-class citizens.
We extend the SPARQL algebra to apply novel optimization techniques to improve the query processing efficiency while maintaining a meaningful ranking of results.
By performing intelligent grouping of query clauses we are able to reduce significantly the communication costs making we approach suitable for top-k hybrid search across multiple data sources.
By performing on-the-fly adaptation of the query execution plan we are able to reduce significantly the communication costs making we approach suitable for top-k hybrid search across multiple data sources.
In experiments we demonstrate that we optimization techniques can lead to a substantial performance improvement, reducing the execution time of hybrid queries by more than an order of magnitude.
