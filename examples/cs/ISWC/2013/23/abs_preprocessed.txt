We present We work on developing a software platform for mining mathematical scholarly papers to obtain a Linked Data representation.
Currently, the Linking Open Data cloud lacks up-to-date information on professional level mathematics.
Currently, the Linking Open Data cloud lacks detailed information on professional level mathematics.
To We mind, the main reason for that is the absence of appropriate tools.
appropriate tools that could analyze the underlying semantics in mathematical papers and effectively build mathematical papers consolidated representation.
ontology based the article body metadata into RDF, integration with some semantic search.
ontology based extraction, conversion of the article body into RDF, integration with some existing Linking Open Data data sets search.

We have developed a holistic approach to analysis of mathematical documents, including ontology.
We argue that the platform may be helpful for enriching user experience on modern online scientific collections.
