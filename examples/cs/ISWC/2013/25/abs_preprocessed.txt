We discuss the problem of minimizing TBoxes.
the lightweight description logic EL which forms a basis of some large ontologies like NCI.
the lightweight description logic EL which forms a basis of some large ontologies like Gene Ontology.
the lightweight description logic EL which forms a basis of some large ontologies like Galen.
the lightweight description logic EL which forms a basis of some large ontologies like SNOMED.
TBoxes expressed in the lightweight description logic EL.
We show that the minimization of TBoxes is intractable ( NP-complete ).
While this looks like a bad news result, We also provide a heuristic technique for minimizing TBoxes.
We show that the heuristics provides optimal results for a class of ontologies.
We prove the correctness of the heuristics.
ontologies which we define through an acyclicity constraint over a reference relation between equivalence classes of concepts.
To establish the feasibility of our approach, our evaluated the algorithm effectiveness on a small suite of benchmarks.
To establish the feasibility of our approach, our have implemented the algorithm.
