With thousands of RDF data sources available on the Web and possibly overlapping knowledge domains, the problem of providing high-level descriptions ( in the form of metadata ) of thousands of RDF data content becomes crucial.
the Web covering disparate.
In this paper we introduce a theoretical framework for describing data sources in terms of data sources completeness.
we show how existing data sources can be described with completeness statements.
completeness statements expressed in RDF.
we then focus on the problem of the completeness of query answering over RDFS data sources augmented with completeness statements.
we then focus on the problem of the completeness of query answering over plain data sources augmented with completeness statements.
Finally, we present an extension of the completeness framework for federated data sources.
