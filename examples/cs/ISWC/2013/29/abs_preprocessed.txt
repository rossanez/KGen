Though subgraph matching has been extensively studied as a query paradigm in semantic web a user can get a large number of answers in response to a query.
Though subgraph matching has been extensively studied as a query paradigm in social network data environments a user can get a large number of answers in response to a query.
Just like Google does, these answers can be shown to the user in accordance with an importance ranking.
SPARQL-queries denoted as importance queries.
In this paper, we present scalable algorithms to find the top-K answers to a practically important subset of SPARQL-queries via a suite of pruning techniques.
algorithms on multiple real-world graph data sets showing that We algorithms are far more efficient than popular triple stores.
We test We algorithms on multiple real-world graph data sets.
algorithms on multiple real-world graph data sets showing that We algorithms are efficient even on networks with up to 6M vertices than popular triple stores.
