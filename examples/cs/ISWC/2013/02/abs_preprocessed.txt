Although an increasing number of RDF knowledge bases are published, many of those lack sophisticated schemata.
Although an increasing number of RDF knowledge bases are published, many of those consist primarily of instance data.
Having such schemata allows more powerful querying.
Having such schemata allows debugging as well as improved inference.
Having such schemata allows consistency checking.
the effort required to create One of the reasons why schemata are still rare.
the reasons why schemata are still rare.
One of the reasons is the effort.
In this article, we propose a semi-automatic schemata construction approach is discovered.
a semi-automatic schemata construction approach addressing this problem: First in existing knowledge bases.
a semi-automatic schemata construction approach addressing this problem: the frequency of axiom patterns in existing knowledge bases.
pattern detection algorithms which allow to enrich knowledge base schemata.
Afterwards, those patterns are converted to SPARQL based pattern detection algorithms.
We argue that We present the first scalable knowledge base enrichment approach based on real schema usage patterns.
the first scalable knowledge base enrichment approach is evaluated on a large set of knowledge bases with qualitative result analysis.
