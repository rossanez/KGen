access control required ( if any ).
When it comes to publishing data on the web, the level of access control is highly dependent on the type of content.
Up until now RDF data publishers have focused on linking public data.

With the advent of SPARQL 1.1, the linked data infrastructure can be used.
With the advent of SPARQL 1.1, the linked data infrastructure can a means of publishing open data but also, as a general mechanism for managing distributed graph data.
However, such a decentralised architecture brings with such a decentralised architecture a number of additional challenges with respect to both data security and integrity.
a general authorisation framework that can be used to cater for the secure manipulation of linked data.
In this paper, we propose a general authorisation framework.
a general authorisation framework that can be used to deliver dynamic query results based on user credentials.
Specifically we describe how graph patterns can together be used to specify consistent access control policies.
Specifically we describe how propagation rules can together be used to enforce consistent access control policies.
