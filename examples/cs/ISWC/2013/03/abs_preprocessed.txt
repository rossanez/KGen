We study confidentiality enforcement in ontology-based information systems where ontologies are expressed in a profile of OWL 2.
We study confidentiality enforcement in ontology-based information systems where ontologies are expressed in OWL 2 RL.
OWL 2 that is becoming increasingly popular in Semantic Web applications.
We formalise a natural adaptation of the Controlled Query Evaluation ( CQE ) framework to ontologies.
CQE algorithms that ensure confidentiality of sensitive information; are efficiently implementable by means of RDF triple store technologies;.
We goal is to provide CQE algorithms.
We goal is to ensure all three requirements.
We formally show that all three requirements are in conflict.
We formally can not be satisfied without imposing restrictions on ontologies.
We propose the identified fragment.
For the identified fragment, We design a CQE algorithm.
a CQE algorithm that has the same computational complexity as standard query answering.
a CQE algorithm that can be implemented by relying on state-of-the-art triple stores.
