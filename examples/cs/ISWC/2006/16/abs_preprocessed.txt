the gold standard based evaluation of ontology learning.
In recent years several measures for the gold standard were proposed.
several measures for the gold standard can be distinguished by the layers of e.g. lexical term layer ) several measures for the gold standard.

several measures for the gold standard can be distinguished by the layers of an ontology ) several measures for the gold standard.
several measures for the gold standard can be distinguished by the layers of e.g. concept hierarchy ) several measures for the gold standard.
the gold standard based evaluation of ontology learning.
the gold standard based evaluation of ontology learning with a list of criteria.
Judging several measures for the gold standard we show that there exist some measures sufficient for evaluating the lexical term layer.
However, existing measures for the evaluation of concept hierarchies fail to meet basic criteria.
a new taxonomic measure which overcomes the problems of current approaches.
This paper presents a new taxonomic measure.
