An ontology alignment explicitly describes the relations.
the relations holding between two ontologies.
A system composed of ontologies interconnecting them.
A system is herein called a distributed system.
A system composed of ontologies interconnecting A system.
A system composed of alignments interconnecting A system.
A system composed of alignments interconnecting them.
We give three different semantics of a distributed system.
a distributed system that do not interfere with the semantics of ontologies.
A system are compared with respect to allowing consistent merge of ontologies.
A system are compared with respect to complying with an alignment composition operation.
A system composed of alignments interconnecting them advantages.
A system composed of ontologies interconnecting them advantages.
A system are compared with respect to managing heterogeneity.
only the first two variants which differ from other proposed semantics.
We show that only the first two variants can offer a sound composition operation.
