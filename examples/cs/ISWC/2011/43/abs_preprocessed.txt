In this paper, we study watermarking methods to prove the ownership of an ontology.
Different from existing approaches, we propose to watermark not by altering existing statements, but by removing existing statements.
Thereby, we approach does not introduce false statements into an ontology.
we show how ownership of ontologies can be established with provably tight probability bounds, even if only parts of an ontology are being re-used.
we finally demonstrate the viability of we approach on real-world ontologies.
