Current ontology development tools offer debugging support by presenting justifications for entailments of OWL ontologies.
While these minimal subsets have been shown to support debugging tasks, the occurrence of multiple justifications presents a significant cognitive challenge to users.

justifications for distinct entailments may be critically related.
In many cases even a single entailment may have many distinct justifications.
However, it is currently unknown how prevalent significant numbers of multiple justifications per entailment are in the field.
To address this lack, we examine the justifications from an independently motivated corpus of actively used biomedical ontologies from the NCBO BioPortal.
structural features ( such as patterns ) which can be exploited in order.
We find that the majority of ontologies contain multiple justifications, while also exhibiting structural features ( such as patterns ) to reduce user effort in the ontology engineering process.
