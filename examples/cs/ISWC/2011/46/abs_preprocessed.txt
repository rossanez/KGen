Semantic Web data with annotations is becoming available, being YAGO knowledge base a prominent example.
annotated semantic web data using standard database technology.
In this paper we present an approach to perform the closure of large RDF Schema annotated semantic web data.
real fuzzy semantic data extracted from YAGO in the PostgreSQL database management system.
In particular, we exploit several alternatives to address the problem of computing transitive closure with real fuzzy semantic data.
we benchmark compare to classical RDF Schema reasoning, providing the first implementation of annotated RDF schema in persistent storage.
we benchmark the several alternatives in persistent storage.
