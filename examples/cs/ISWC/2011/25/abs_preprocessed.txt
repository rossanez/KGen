The MapReduce framework has proved to be very efficient for data-intensive tasks.
Earlier work has shown promising results.
Earlier work has tried to use MapReduce for large scale reasoning for pD semantics.
In this paper, we move a step forward to consider scalable reasoning on top of semantic data under fuzzy pD semantics ).
In this paper, we move a step forward to consider scalable reasoning on top of semantic data under i.e., an extension of OWL pD semantics with fuzzy vagueness ).
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to investigate how MapReduce for large scale reasoning for pD semantics can help to solve the scalability issue of fuzzy OWL reasoning.
While most of the optimizations are also applicable for fuzzy pD semantics, unique challenges arise when we handle the fuzzy information.
the optimizations used by the existing MapReduce framework for pD semantics.
We propose a solution for tackling each of these key challenges.
We identify these key challenges.
Furthermore, we implement a prototype system for the evaluation purpose.
The experimental results show that the running time of a prototype system for the evaluation purpose is comparable with that of WebPIE, the state-of-the-art inference engine for scalable reasoning in pD semantics.
