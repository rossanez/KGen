Ontology verification is concerned with the relationship between the models of the axiomatization of an ontology.
The verification of a particular ontology requires characterization of the models of an ontology up to isomorphism that the models of the ontology are equivalent to the intended structures for an ontology.
The verification of a particular ontology requires characterization of the models of an ontology up to a proof that the models of the ontology are equivalent to the intended structures for an ontology.

In this paper we provide the verification of the ontology of time which is a first-order axiomatization of OWL-Time.
we present a complete account of the metatheoretic relationships among five modules.
we present a complete account of the metatheoretic relationships between other time ontologies for points.
we identify five modules within an ontology.
we present a complete account of the metatheoretic relationships between other time ontologies for intervals.
