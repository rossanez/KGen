Outlier detection is typically applied to single datasets to search data for values of unexpected behavior.
Outlier detection used for identifying wrong values in data.
In this work, we instead propose an approach.
natural outliers which are exceptional values in the dataset.
problems arising from natural outliers.
natural outliers which are nevertheless correct.
an approach which combines the outcomes of two independent outlier detection runs to also prevent problems.
an approach which combines the outcomes of two independent outlier detection runs to get a more reliable result.
Linked Data is especially suited for the application of such an idea, since Linked Data also contains explicit links between instances.
data enriched with hierarchical information.
Linked Data is especially suited for the application of such an idea, since Linked Data provides large amounts of data.
In a first step, we apply outlier detection methods to the property values using a novel approach for splitting the data into relevant subsets.
the property values extracted from a single repository.
For the second step, we exploit owl: sameAs links for the instances to get additional property values.
For the second step, we exploit owl: sameAs links for the instances to perform a second outlier detection on additional property values.
Doing so allows us to reject the assessment of a wrong value.
Doing so allows us to confirm the assessment of a wrong value.
Experiments on the DBpedia datasets demonstrate the feasibility of our approach.
Experiments on the NELL datasets demonstrate the feasibility of our approach.
