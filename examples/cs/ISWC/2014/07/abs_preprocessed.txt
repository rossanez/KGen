The increase in the volume and heterogeneity of biomedical data sources has motivated researchers to embrace Linked Data technologies to solve the ensuing integration challenges.
The increase in the volume and heterogeneity of biomedical data sources enhance information discovery.
As an integral part of the EU GRANATUM project, a Linked Biomedical Dataspace augment the design of in silico experiments for cancer chemoprevention drug discovery.
As an integral part of the EU GRANATUM project, a Linked Biomedical Dataspace was developed to semantically interlink data from multiple sources.
The different components of the a Linked Biomedical Dataspace facilitate both the biomedical researchers to publish, link, query.
The different components of the a Linked Biomedical Dataspace visually explore the heterogeneous datasets.
The different components of the a Linked Biomedical Dataspace facilitate both the bioinformaticians to publish, link, query.
We have extensively evaluated the usability of the entire platform.
three different workflows depicting real-world scenarios on the use of a Linked Biomedical Dataspace by the domain users to intuitively retrieve meaningful information from the integrated sources.
In this paper, We showcase three different workflows.
We accumulated experience during the collaborative processes.
We report the important lessons that We learned through the challenges encountered.
the collaborative processes which would make it easier for Linked Data practitioners to create such dataspaces in other domains.
We also provide a concise set of generic recommendations to develop Linked Data platforms useful for drug discovery.
