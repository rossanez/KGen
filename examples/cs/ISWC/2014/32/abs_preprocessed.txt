A considerable portion of the information on the Semantic Web is still only available in unstructured form.
Implementing the vision of the Semantic Web thus requires transforming this unstructured data into structured data.
One key step during this process is the recognition of named entities.
Previous works suggest that ensemble learning can be used to improve the performance of named entity recognition tools.
However, no comparison of the performance of existing supervised machine has been presented so far.
existing supervised machine learning approaches on this task.
We address this research gap by presenting a thorough evaluation of named entity recognition based on ensemble learning.
To this end, We evaluate ensemble learning performace on five different datasets.
To this end, We combine four different state-of-the approaches by using 15 different algorithms for ensemble learning.
We results suggest that ensemble learning can reduce the error rate of state-of-the-art named entity recognition systems by 40.
