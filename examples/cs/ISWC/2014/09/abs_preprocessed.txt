The recent big data movement resulted in a surge of activity on layering declarative languages on top of distributed computation platforms.
In the Semantic Web realm, this surge of analytics languages was not reflected despite the significant growth in the available Semantic Web data.
Consequently, when analysing large RDF datasets, users are left with an existing non-RDF-specific own limitations.
Consequently, when analysing large RDF datasets, users are left with two main options: using SPARQL or using an existing non-RDF-specific big data language.
the high cost of evaluation can be limiting in some scenarios.
The pure declarative nature of SPARQL can be limiting in some scenarios.
On the other hand, existing big data languages are designed mainly for tabular data and, therefore, applying languages to Semantic Web data results in verbose, unreadable scripts.
On the other hand, existing big data languages are designed mainly for tabular data and, therefore, applying languages to Semantic Web data results in verbose, sometimes inefficient scripts.
a dataflow language designed to process Semantic Web data at a large scale.
In this paper, we introduce a dataflow language.
In this paper, we introduce SYRql.
SYRql blends concepts from both SPARQL languages.
SYRql blends concepts from existing big data languages.
a closed algebra that discuss a closed algebra.
We formally define a closed algebra and some unique optimisation opportunities this algebra provides properties and some unique optimisation opportunities this algebra provides.
a closed algebra that underlies SYRql.
a closed algebra that underlies SYRql.
a closed algebra that discuss its properties.
Furthermore, we describe an implementation.
an implementation that compare the performance to other big data processing languages.
an implementation that translates SYRql scripts into a series of MapReduce jobs.
