In this paper we show how event processing over semantically annotated streams of events can be exploited, for implementing tracking of products in supply chains through the automated generation of linked pedigrees.
In this paper we show how event processing over semantically annotated streams of events can be exploited, for implementing tracing of products in supply chains through the automated generation of linked pedigrees.
In our abstraction, events are encoded as spatially and temporally oriented named graphs, while linked pedigrees as RDF datasets are linked pedigrees as RDF datasets specific compositions.
our propose an algorithm.
an algorithm that operates over streams of RDF annotated EPCIS events to generate linked pedigrees.
our show how counterfeit detection is an implicit part of our pedigree generation.
our exemplify our approach using the pharmaceuticals supply chain.
our evaluation results show that for fast moving supply chains, smaller window sizes on event streams enable early counterfeit detection.
our evaluation results show that for fast moving supply chains, smaller window sizes on event streams provide significantly higher efficiency in the generation of pedigrees.
