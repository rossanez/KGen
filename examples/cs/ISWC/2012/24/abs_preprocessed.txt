the syntactic similarity of the extracted base with the original one.
the size of the corresponding signature of the extracted base with the original one.
the size of the extracted base of the extracted base with the original one.
Three conflicting requirements arise in the context of knowledge base extraction of the extracted base with the original one.
Minimal module extraction assign an absolute priority to one of these requirements, thereby limiting the possibilities to influence the other two.
uniform interpolation assign an absolute priority to one of these requirements, thereby limiting the possibilities to influence the other two.
EL that does not require such an extreme prioritization.
We propose a novel technique for EL.
EL that does not require such an extreme prioritization with existing approaches with encouraging results.
We propose a tractable rewriting approach.
empirically compare a novel technique for EL.
