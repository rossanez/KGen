an RDF graph which is not identified by a URI.
In RDF, a blank node ) is a node in an RDF graph.
an RDF graph which is not a literal.
In RDF, or anonymous resource ) is a node in an RDF graph.
In RDF, or bnode ) is a node in an RDF graph.
Several RDFS Knowledge Bases -RRB- attributes ( either associations with other resources ) are known.

complex attributes or resources whose identity is unknown.
Several RDFS Knowledge Bases rely heavily on blank nodes as Several RDFS Knowledge Bases -LRB- Several RDFS Knowledge Bases -RRB- are convenient for representing complex attributes or resources.

In this paper we show how we can exploit blank nodes anonymity in order to reduce the delta ) size when comparing such Several RDFS Knowledge Bases.
In this paper we show how we can exploit blank nodes anonymity in order to reduce diff ) size when comparing such Several RDFS Knowledge Bases.
The main idea of the proposed method is to build a mapping between the bnodes of the compared Several RDFS Knowledge Bases for reducing the delta size.
We prove that finding the optimal mapping is polynomial in case there are not directly connected bnodes.
We prove that finding the optimal mapping is NP-Hard in the general case.
Subsequently We present various polynomial algorithms returning approximate solutions for the general case.
