understanding various contexts of users is important to enable personalised selection of Web APIs in directories such as Programmable Web.
Modelling various contexts of users is important to enable personalised selection of Web APIs in directories such as Programmable Web.
Currently, relationships between Web APIs are not clearly understood by existing selection approaches.
Currently, relationships between users are not clearly utilized by existing selection approaches.

a Web API directory graph that captures relationships such as categories.
a Web API directory graph that captures relationships such as developers.
In this paper, we present a semantic model of a Web API directory graph.
a Web API directory graph that captures relationships such as Web APIs.
a Web API directory graph that captures relationships such as mashups.
We describe a novel configurable graph-based method for selection of Web APIs with temporal aspects.
We describe a novel configurable graph-based method for selection of Web APIs with personalised aspects.
a novel configurable graph-based method for selection of Web APIs allows users to get more control over users preferences and recommended Web APIs while users can exploit information about users social links and preferences.
We evaluate a novel configurable graph-based method for selection of Web APIs on a real-world dataset from ProgrammableWeb.com.
We show that a novel configurable graph-based method for selection of Web APIs provides more contextualised results than currently available popularity-based rankings.
