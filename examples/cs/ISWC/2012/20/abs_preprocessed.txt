Web APIs have gained increasing popularity in recent Web service technology development.
Web APIs have gained the proliferation of mashups.
recent Web service technology development owing to Web APIs simplicity of technology stack.
However, efficiently discovering Web APIs is still a challenging task even with the best resources available on the Web.
However, efficiently discovering the relevant documentations on the Web is still a challenging task even with the best resources available on the Web.
In this paper we cast the problem of detecting the Web API documentations as a text classification problem of classifying a given Web page as Web API associated or not.
a supervised generative topic model called feature latent Dirichlet allocation.
We propose a supervised generative topic model.
feature latent Dirichlet allocation which offers a generic probabilistic framework for automatic detection of Web APIs.
feature latent Dirichlet allocation not only also provides a mechanism for incorporating side information such as labelled features automatically learned from data.
feature latent Dirichlet allocation not only captures the correspondence between data automatically learned from data.
data that can effectively help improving classification performance.
