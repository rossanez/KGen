Determining trust of data available in the Semantic Web is fundamental for applications in particular for linked open data endpoints.
There exist several proposals in the literature to annotate SPARQL query results with values from abstract models, adapting the seminal works on provenance for annotated relational databases.
We provide an approach capable of providing provenance information for a large fragment .
We provide an approach capable of providing provenance information for a significant fragment .
We provide an approach capable of providing provenance information for for the first time the major non-monotonic constructs under multiset semantics.
The approach is based on the translation of SPARQL into relational queries over annotated relations with values of the most general m-semiring also refuting a claim in the literature that the OPTIONAL construct of SPARQL can not be captured appropriately with the known abstract models.
