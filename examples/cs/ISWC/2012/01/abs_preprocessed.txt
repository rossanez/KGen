Ontology mappings are often assigned a weight factor by matchers.
Ontology mappings are often assigned a confidence factor by matchers.
Nonetheless, few semantic accounts have been given so far for such weights.
This paper presents a formal semantics for weighted mappings between different ontologies.
X classified in the concepts of O 1.
It is based on a classificational interpretation of mappings: if O 2 are two ontologies then mappings between O 1 are interpreted to encode how elements of X are re-classified in the concepts of O 2.

weights are interpreted to measure how complete re-classifications are.
two ontologies used to classify a common set X.
weights are interpreted to measure how precise re-classifications are.
This semantics is justifiable by extensional practice of ontology matching.
This semantics is a conservative extension of a semantics of crisp mappings.
