The paper presents an approach for cost-based query planning for SPARQL queries issued over an OWL ontology using the OWL Direct Semantics entailment regime of SPARQL 1.1.
properties that are extracted from a model abstraction.
The costs are based on information about the instances of classes.

classes that are extracted from a model abstraction.
A static are presented which use The costs to find near optimal execution orders for the atoms of a query.
a dynamic algorithm are presented which use The costs to find near optimal execution orders for the atoms of a query.

an individual clustering approach that allows for computing the cost functions based on one individual sample from a cluster.
For the dynamic case, we improve the performance by exploiting an individual clustering approach.
we experimental study shows that the static outperforms the dynamic one when accurate statistics are available.
the static ordering usually.
This changes, however, when the statistics are less accurate.
This changes, however, when the statistics are due to non-deterministic reasoning decisions.
