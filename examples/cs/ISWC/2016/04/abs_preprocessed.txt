Conjunctive query answering over expressive Horn Description Logic ontologies is a relevant problem which, in some cases, can be addressed by application of the chase algorithm.
Conjunctive query answering over expressive Horn Description Logic ontologies is a challenging problem which, in some cases, can be addressed by application of the chase algorithm.
a novel acyclicity notion which provides a sufficient condition for termination of the restricted chase over Horn.
In this paper, we define a novel acyclicity notion.
a novel acyclicity notion which provides SRIQ TBoxes.
We show that a novel acyclicity notion generalizes most of the existing acyclicity conditions ( both theoretically ).
a novel acyclicity notion which provides SRIQ TBoxes.
a novel acyclicity notion which provides a sufficient condition for termination of the restricted chase over Horn.
We show that a novel acyclicity notion generalizes most of the existing acyclicity conditions ( both empirically ).
a novel acyclicity notion which provides a sufficient condition for termination of the restricted chase over Horn.
Furthermore, a novel acyclicity notion gives rise to a very efficient reasoning procedure.
a novel acyclicity notion which provides SRIQ TBoxes.
acyclic ontologies which outperforms other state-of-the-art systems.
a materialization based reasoner for acyclic ontologies.
We provide evidence for this by providing a materialization.
