During recent years, more data has been published as native RDF datasets.

In this setup, both the need to process aggregate queries represent challenges for standard SPARQL query processing techniques.
In this setup, both the size of the datasets represent challenges for standard SPARQL query processing techniques.
To overcome these limitations, materialized views can be used as a source of precomputed partial results during query processing.

However, materialized view techniques as proposed for RDF do not support RDF specifics, such as incompleteness to support implicit information.

To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes MARVEL ( MAterialized Rdf Views with Entailment ).

a view selection algorithm based on an associated RDF-specific cost model, a view definition syntax.
rewriting SPARQL queries using.
The approach consists of a view selection algorithm.
an algorithm for rewriting SPARQL queries materialized RDF views.
The experimental evaluation shows that MARVEL can improve query response time by more than an order of magnitude while effectively handling RDF specifics.
