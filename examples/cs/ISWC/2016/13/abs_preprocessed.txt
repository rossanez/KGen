Despite developments of the Semantic Web technologies, the gap between non-expert end-users still exists.
Despite developments of the Semantic Web technologies, the gap between the Semantic Web still exists.
In the field of semantic content authoring, tools for interacting with semantic content remain directed at highly trained individuals.
this paper adds to the challenges of bringing user-generated content into the Semantic Web.
In this paper, we present Seed, short for Semantic Editor, an extensible knowledge-supported natural language text composition tool for non-experienced end-users.
Semantic Editor enables automatic creation of standards.
Semantic Editor enables semi-automatic creation of standards.
standards based semantically annotated textual content with focus on the task of text composition.
We point out the structure of Seed, explain how Semantic Editor excels at utilizing Linked Open Data to realize user-friendly generation of textual content for the Semantic Web.
We point out the structure of Seed, explain how Semantic Editor excels at utilizing state of the art Natural Language Processing to realize user-friendly generation of textual content for the Semantic Web.
We point out the structure of Seed, compare Semantic Editor with related work.
120 participants which showed that Seed helped end-users easily interact with semantic content with nearly no prerequisite knowledge.

We also present experimental evaluation results involving a diverse group of 120 participants.
