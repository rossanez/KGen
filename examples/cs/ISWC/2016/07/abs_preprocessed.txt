Finding associations between entities is a common information need in many areas.
the Web describing relations between entities.
It has been facilitated by the increasing amount of graph-structured data on the Web.
a minimal connected subgraph containing all of them.
In this paper, we define an association.
an association connecting multiple entities in a graph as a minimal connected subgraph.
We propose an efficient graph search algorithm for finding associations.
entities computed based on a distance oracle.
associations which prunes the search space by exploiting distances between entities.
Having found a possibly large group of associations, we propose to mine frequent association patterns as a conceptual abstract.
a conceptual abstract summarizing notable subgroups to present an efficient mining algorithm based on canonical codes and partitions.
a conceptual abstract summarizing notable subgroups to be explored.
Extensive experiments on large, real RDF datasets demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithms.
