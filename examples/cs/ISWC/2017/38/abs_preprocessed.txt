A conditional key is a key constraint that is valid in only a part of the data.
In this paper, we show how such keys can be mined automatically on large knowledge bases.
For this, we combine techniques from key mining with techniques from rule mining.
we show that we method can scale to large knowledge bases of millions of facts.
we also show that the conditional keys we we can improve the quality of entity linking by up to 47percent points.
