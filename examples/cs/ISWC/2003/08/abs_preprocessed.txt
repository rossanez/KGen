Semantic coordination, namely the problem of finding an agreement on the meaning of heterogeneous semantic models, is one of the key issues in the development of the Semantic Web.
hierarchical classifications based on a new approach to semantic coordination.
In this paper, we propose a new algorithm for discovering semantic mappings across hierarchical classifications.
a new approach shifts the problem of semantic coordination from the problem of computing linguistic similarities ( what most other proposed approaches do ) to the problem of deducing relations between sets of logical formulae.
logical formulae that represent the meaning of concepts.
concepts belonging to different models.
a new approach shifts the problem of semantic coordination from the problem of computing structural similarities ( what most other proposed approaches do ) to the problem of deducing relations between sets of logical formulae.
We show how to apply a new algorithm to an interesting family of semantic models, namely hierarchical classifications,.

We show how to present the results of preliminary tests on two types of catalogs.
We show how to present the results of preliminary tests on two types of web directories.
We show how to present the results of preliminary tests on two types of hierarchical classifications.
Finally, We argue why this is a significant improvement on previous approaches.
