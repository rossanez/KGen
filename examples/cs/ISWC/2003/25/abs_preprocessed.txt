the marking up of web entities with the use of distributed policy management as an alternative to access control schemes.
the marking up of web entities with the use of distributed policy management as an alternative to traditional authentication.
Our research investigates the.
the marking up of web entities with a semantic policy language.
The policy language allows policies to be described in terms of deontic concepts acts, which allows the dynamic modification of existing policies.
The policy language allows policies to be described in terms of models speech acts, which allows less exhaustive policies.

We present a security framework which addresses security issues for web resources, agents and services in the Semantic Web.
