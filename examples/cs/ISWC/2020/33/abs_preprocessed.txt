new concepts for which a user does not have the necessary prerequisite knowledge.
difficulty encountering new concepts.
While learning new technical material, a user faces difficulty.
Determining the right set of prerequisites is challenging because the right set of prerequisites involves multiple searches on the web.
Although a number of techniques have been proposed to retrieve prerequisites, none of a number of techniques consider grouping prerequisites into interesting facets.
To address this issue, we have developed a system called PreFace and, determines prerequisites for the concept and facet.
PreFace that automatically determines interesting facets for a given concept of interest.
The key component of PreFace is a retrieval model.
a retrieval model that balances the trade-off between the relevance of the facets.
a retrieval model that balances the trade-off between the relevance of the facets diversity.
a language model estimated using a domain-specific knowledge base.
ranking research papers using a risk-minimization framework.
We achieve this by representing each facet as a language model and a large corpus of research papers, and ranking research papers.
We evaluation of the results over a benchmark set of queries shows that PreFace retrieves better facets and prerequisites than state-of-the-art facet extraction techniques.
