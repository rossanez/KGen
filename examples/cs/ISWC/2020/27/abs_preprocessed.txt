With the ever-increasing number of RDF-based knowledge graphs, the number of interconnections between these graphs sameAs property has exploded.
the number of interconnections between these graphs using the owl.
Moreover, as several works indicate, the identity as defined by the semantics of owl: sameAs could be too rigid.
Moreover, as several works indicate, the identity as defined by the semantics of owl: sameAs property is therefore often misused.
Indeed, identity must be seen as context-dependent.
These facts lead to poor quality data.
poor quality data when using the owl.
poor quality data when using sameAs inference capabilities.
Therefore, contextual identity could be a possible path to better quality knowledge.
Unlike classical identity, with contextual identity, only certain properties can be propagated between contextually identical entities.
Continuing this work on contextual identity, we propose an approach to find semi-automatically a set of properties, for a given identity context.
a given identity context that can be propagated between contextually identical entities.
an approach based on sentence embedding.
Quantitative experiments against a gold standard show that our approach achieved promising results.

Besides, the use cases demonstrate that identifying the properties helps users achieve the desired results.
