We introduce an approach to semantically represent raster data in a Semantic Web graph.
We introduce an approach to semantically query raster data in a Semantic Web graph.
We extend query language to support raster data as a new type of geospatial data.
We extend the GeoSPARQL vocabulary to support raster data as a new type of geospatial data.
We illustrate We approach using several use cases on real-world data sets.
We define new filter functions.
Finally, We describe a prototypical implementation.
Finally, We validate the feasibility of We approach.
