The availability of streaming data sources is progressively increasing thanks to the development of ubiquitous data capturing technologies such as sensor networks.
The heterogeneity of streaming data sources introduces the requirement of providing data access in a unified manner, whilst allowing the user to express streaming data sources needs at an ontological level.
The heterogeneity of streaming data sources introduces the requirement of providing data access in a coherent manner, whilst allowing the user to express streaming data sources needs at an ontological level.
In this paper we describe an ontology-based streaming data access service.
Sources link Sources data content to ontologies through s 2o mappings.
the ontology using an extension of sparql for streaming data.
Users can query the ontology.
the ontology using sparql Stream.
A preliminary implementation of the approach is also presented.
With A preliminary implementation of the approach we expect to set the basis for future efforts in ontology-based streaming data integration.
