relatedness measures between ontology concepts are useful in many research areas.
Semantic similarity between ontology concepts are useful in many research areas.
While similarity only considers subsumption relations to assess how two objects are alike, relatedness takes into account a broader range of e.g., part-of ).

In this paper, we present The proposed framework.
A new way of computing IC values directly from an ontology structure is also introduced.
This new model called Extended Information Content.
semantic relations defined in an ontology.
This new model takes into account the whole set of semantic relations.
existing similarity measures that can be augmented to compute semantic relatedness.
The proposed framework enables to rewrite existing similarity measures.
a new measure called Feature ).
a new measure called FaITH ).
a new measure called Information THeoretic ).
Upon The proposed framework, a new measure has been devised.
Extensive experimental evaluations confirmed the suitability of The proposed framework.
