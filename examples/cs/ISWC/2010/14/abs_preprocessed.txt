Ontology classification— the computation of subsumption hierarchies for classes is one of the most important tasks for OWL reasoners.
Ontology classification— the computation of subsumption hierarchies for properties is one of the most important tasks for OWL reasoners.
Based on the algorithm by Shearer we present a new classification procedure that uses several novel optimisations in order to achieve superior performance.
Based on the algorithm by Horrocks we present a new classification procedure that addresses several open issues of the original algorithm.

we also consider the classification of properties.
we show that algorithms commonly used to implement that task are incomplete even for relatively weak ontology languages.
Furthermore, we show how to reduce the property classification problem into a standard classification problem.
a standard classification problem which allows reasoners to classify properties using we optimised procedure.
we implemented we algorithms in the OWL HermiT reasoner.
we present the results of a performance evaluation.
