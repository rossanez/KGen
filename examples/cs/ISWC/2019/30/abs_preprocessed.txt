RDF has been recently introduced as a W3C recommendation to define constraints that can be validated against RDF graphs.
Interactions of SHACL with other Semantic Web technologies, such as reasoners, is a matter of ongoing research.
Interactions of SHACL with other Semantic Web technologies, such as ontologies, is a matter of ongoing research.
In this paper we study the interaction of a subset of SHACL with expressed in datalog.
On the one hand, SHACL constraints can be used to define a `` schema '' for graph datasets.
On the other hand, inference rules can lead to the discovery of new facts that do not match the original schema.
Given a set of SHACL constraints and a set of datalog rules, we present a method to detect which constraints could be violated by the application of the inference rules on some graph instance of the original schema, and update the original schema, i.e, the set of SHACL constraints, in order to capture the new facts that can be inferred.
We provide theoretical results of the various components of We approach.
We provide experimental results of the various components of We approach.
