The formal approach realized in NoHR is w.r.t. data complexity ).
The formal approach realized in NoHR is polynomial ).
The formal approach realized in NoHR has been shown that even very large health care ontologies, such as SNOMED CT, can be handled.
As each of the tractable OWL profiles is motivated by different application cases, extending the tool to the other profiles is of particular interest, also because the other profiles preserve the polynomial data complexity of the combined formalism.
Yet, a straightforward adaptation of the existing approach to OWL 2 QL turns out to not be viable.
In this paper, we provide the non-trivial solution for the extension of NoHR to OWL 2 QL by directly translating the ontology into rules without any prior classification.
we have implemented we approach.
we evaluation shows encouraging results.
