However.
existing approaches to ontology Automated acquisition are considerably limited.
e.g. focus on Automated acquisition descriptions for given classes, require intense supervision.
human involvement, make assumptions about data, do not fully respect background knowledge.
We investigate the problem of general terminology induction, i.e. Automated acquisition sets of general class inclusions, GCIs, from background knowledge.
We investigate the problem of general terminology induction, i.e. Automated acquisition sets of general class inclusions, GCIs, from data.
We introduce measures.
measures that evaluate statistical quality of a set of GCIs.
measures that evaluate logical quality of a set of GCIs.
We present methods to compute these measures.
We present methods to compute an anytime algorithm.
an anytime algorithm that induces sets of GCIs.
We experiments show that We can provide insights into the structure of the search space.
We experiments show that We can acquire interesting sets of GCIs.
