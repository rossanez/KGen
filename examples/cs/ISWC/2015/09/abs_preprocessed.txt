Entity navigation over Linked Data often follows semantic links by using Linked Data browsers.
With the increasing volume of Linked Data, the diverse links make it difficult for users to find target entities.
With the increasing volume of Linked Data, the diverse links make it difficult for users to traverse the link graph.
With the increasing volume of Linked Data, the rich links make it difficult for users to traverse the link graph.
With the increasing volume of Linked Data, the rich links make it difficult for users to find target entities.
Besides, there is entity-set-oriented transition.
Besides, there is single-entity-oriented transition.
Besides, there is a necessity for navigation paradigm to take into account.
To facilitate entity navigation, we propose a novel concept and introduce link pattern lattice to organize semantic links when browsing an entity.
To facilitate entity navigation, we propose a novel concept and introduce link pattern lattice to organize semantic links when browsing a set of entities.
a novel concept called link pattern.
Furthermore, to help users quickly find target entities, top-K link patterns are selected for entity navigation.
The proposed approach is implemented in a prototype system.
The proposed approach is then compared with two Linked Data browsers via a user study.
Experimental results show that The proposed approach is effective.
