scalable distributed reasoning proposing a technique for materialising the closure of an RDF graph based on MapReduce.
We address the problem of scalable distributed reasoning.
We have implemented We approach on top of Hadoop.
We have deployed Hadoop on a compute cluster of up to 64 commodity machines.
We show that a naive implementation on top of MapReduce is straightforward.
We show that We present several non-trivial optimisations.
We show that a naive implementation on top of MapReduce performs badly.
We algorithm is scalable.
We algorithm allows us to compute the RDFS closure of 865M triples from the Web ( producing 30B triples ) in less than two hours, faster than any other published approach.
