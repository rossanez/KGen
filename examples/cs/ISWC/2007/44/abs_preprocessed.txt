Hierarchical classifications are used pervasively by humans as a means to organize Hierarchical classifications data about the world.
Hierarchical classifications are used pervasively by humans as a means to organize knowledge about the world.
One of their main advantages is that natural language labels are easily understood by human users.
natural language labels used to describe Hierarchical classifications contents.
natural language labels used to describe their contents.
However, at the same time, this is also one of their main disadvantages as natural language labels are very hard to be reasoned about by software agents.
However, at the same time, this is also one of their main disadvantages as natural language labels are ambiguous.
This fact creates an insuperable hindrance for classifications to being embedded in the Semantic Web infrastructure.
