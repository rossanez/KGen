Ontologies proliferate with the growth of the Semantic Web.
However, most of data on the Semantic Web are still stored in relational databases.
Therefore, it is important to establish interoperability between relational databases and ontologies for creating a Web of data.
An effective way to achieve interoperability is finding mappings between relational database schemas and ontologies.
In this paper, we propose a new approach to discovering simple mappings between an ontology.
In this paper, we propose a new approach to discovering simple mappings between a relational database schema.
this paper eliminates incorrect mappings via validating mapping consistency.
this paper exploits simple mappings based on virtual documents.
contextual mappings which is useful for practical applications.
Additionally, this paper called contextual mappings.
Experimental results demonstrate that our approach performs well on several data sets from real world domains.
