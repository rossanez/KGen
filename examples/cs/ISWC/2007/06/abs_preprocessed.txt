An important open question in the semantic Web is the precise relationship between the RDF ( S ) semantics.
An important open question in the semantic Web is the semantics of standard knowledge representation formalisms such as logic programming.
An important open question in the semantic Web is the semantics of standard knowledge representation formalisms such as description logics.
In this paper we address this issue by considering these embeddings in logic.
Using these embeddings, combined with existing results about various fragments of logic, we establish several novel complexity results.
these embeddings we consider show how techniques from description logics can be used for reasoning with RDF.
these embeddings we consider show how techniques from deductive databases can be used for reasoning with RDF.
Finally, we consider establish the data complexity of conjunctive querying for the various RDF entailment regimes.
Finally, we consider querying RDF graphs.
