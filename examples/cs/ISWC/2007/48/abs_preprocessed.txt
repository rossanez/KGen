This paper deals with the problem of exploring hierarchical semantics from social annotations.
Recently, social annotation services have become more popular in Semantic Web.
Recently, social annotation services have become more popular in Semantic Web.
social annotation services allows users to arbitrarily annotate web resources, thus, largely lowers the barrier to cooperation.
Furthermore, through providing abundant meta-data resources, social annotation might become a key to the development of Semantic Web.
However, on the other hand, social annotation has 1 ) ambiguity and synonym phenomena.
However, on the other hand, social annotation has the other hand own apparent limitations, for instance.
However, on the other hand, social annotation has 2 ) lack of hierarchical information.
In This paper, we propose an unsupervised model to automatically derive hierarchical semantics from social annotations.
the derived hierarchical semantics.
Using a social bookmark service Del.icio.us as example, we demonstrate that the has the ability to compensate those shortcomings.
We further apply We model on another data set from Flickr to testify We model’s applicability on different environments.
The experimental results demonstrate our model's efficiency.
