In open environments ontology mapping provides interoperability between interacting actors.
In distributed environments ontology mapping provides interoperability between interacting actors.
However, conventional mapping systems focus on mapping whole ontologies.
However, conventional mapping systems focus on acquiring static information.
whole ontologies which is infeasible in open systems.
This paper shows that the interactions the interactions themselves between the actors between the interactions themselves between the actors can be used to predict mappings, simplifying dynamic ontology mapping.
similar conventions and patterns which can be analysed.
The intuitive idea is that similar interactions follow similar conventions and patterns.
The computed model can be used to suggest the possible mappings for the exchanged messages in new interactions.
The suggestions can be evaluate by any standard ontology matcher: if The suggestions are accurate, the matchers avoid evaluating mappings unrelated to the interaction.
