A central requirement for achieving the vision of run-time discovery is the provision of appropriate descriptions of the operation of a service.
A central requirement for achieving dynamic composition of services is the provision of appropriate descriptions of the operation of a service.
a service that is, how a service interacts with other services.
a service that is, how a service interacts with agents.
In this paper, we use experience gained through the development of real-life Grid applications to produce a set of those requirements to match those requirements against the offerings of existing work, such as IRS-II.
In this paper, we use experience gained through the development of real-life Grid applications to produce a set of those requirements to match those requirements against the offerings of existing work, such as OWL-S.
Based on this analysis we identify which requirements are not addressed by current research and, in response, produce a model for describing the interaction protocol of a service in response.
The main contributions of a model are the ability to describe the interactions of multiple parties with respect to a single service, distinguish between interactions the service.
parties that are either a result of internal service events or interactions.
interactions that are initiated by clients.
other cooperating services.
The main contributions of a model are the ability to describe the interactions of multiple parties with respect to a single service, distinguish between interactions interactions or other and capture within the description service state changes relevant to interacting parties.
interactions initiated by the service.
The aim of a model is not to replace existing work, since a model only focuses on the description of the interaction protocol of a service.
