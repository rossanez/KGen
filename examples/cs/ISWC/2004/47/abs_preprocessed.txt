the available ontologies are seen as the solution to data heterogeneity on the web.
However, the available ontologies are the available ontologies source of heterogeneity.
This can be overcome by finding the correspondence between the available ontologies components.
This can be overcome by aligning ontologies.
These alignments deserve to be treated as objects: These alignments can be transformed into a set of a translation program.
These alignments deserve to be treated as objects: These alignments can be compared with other alignments.
an algorithm that improves a particular alignment.
These alignments deserve to be treated as objects: These alignments can be completed by an algorithm.
These alignments deserve to be treated as objects: These alignments can be transformed into a set of axioms.
These alignments deserve to be treated as objects: These alignments can be referenced on the web as such.
We present here a format for expressing alignments in RDF, so that These alignments can be published on the web.
an Alignment API which shares some design goals with the OWL API.
Then We propose an implementation of this format as an Alignment API.
an Alignment API which can be seen as an extension of the OWL API.
We show how the OWL API can be used for effectively aligning ontologies.
We show how the OWL API can be used for completing partial alignments, generating axioms and transformations.
We show how the OWL API can be used for completing partial alignments, thresholding alignments.
