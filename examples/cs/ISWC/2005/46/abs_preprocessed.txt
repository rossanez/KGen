specialised agents that provides efficient gathering from diverse resources.
This paper presents serse– SEmantic Routing SystEm– a distributed multi-agent system.
a distributed multi-agent system composed of specialised agents.
specialised agents that provides aggregation of digital content from diverse resources.
specialised agents that provides robust gathering from diverse resources.
The agents.
The agents composing serse use ontological descriptions to search semantically annotated knowledge sources, by maintaining a semantic index of the instances of the annotation ontology.
The agents composing serse use ontological descriptions to retrieve semantically annotated knowledge sources, by maintaining a semantic index of the instances of the annotation ontology.
The efficient retrieval is made The efficient retrieval possible through the semantic routing mechanism without having to maintain a central index.
The efficient retrieval is made The efficient retrieval possible through the semantic routing mechanism by reducing the number of messages.
messages broadcasted to the system.
the semantic routing mechanism that permits to identify the agent indexing the resources requested by a user query.
the system is also capable of exhibiting autonomic behaviour.
Autonomic behaviour is characterised by self configuration aimed at permitting the system to manage the failure of one of its agents.
Autonomic behaviour is characterised by self healing capabilities aimed at permitting the system to manage the failure of one of its agents.
Autonomic behaviour is characterised by self healing capabilities aimed at permitting the system to ensure continuous functioning.
