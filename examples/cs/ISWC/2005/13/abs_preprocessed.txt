Swoogle helps software agents.
Semantic Web knowledge encoded in OWL documents on the Web.
Semantic Web knowledge encoded in RDF documents on the Web.
knowledge engineers find Semantic Web knowledge.
Navigating such a Semantic Web on the Web is difficult due to the paucity of explicit hyperlinks beyond the namespaces in URIrefs and the few inter-document links like rdfs: owl imports.

a novel Semantic Web navigation model providing additional navigation paths through Swoogle’s search services such as the Ontology Dictionary.
In order to solve this issue, this paper proposes a novel Semantic Web navigation model.
Using a novel Semantic Web navigation model providing additional navigation paths through Swoogle's search services such as the Ontology Dictionary, we have developed algorithms for ranking the importance of the Web objects at three levels of granularity: documents, terms.

Experiments show that Swoogle outperforms other ontology libraries in finding more ontologies, ranking Experiments importance,.
Experiments show that Swoogle outperforms conventional web search engine in thus promoting the use and emergence of consensus ontologies.
