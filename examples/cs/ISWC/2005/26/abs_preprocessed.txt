One of the major problems of large scale, distributed is the potential introduction of inconsistencies.
evolving ontologies is the potential introduction of inconsistencies.
In this paper we survey four different approaches to handling consistent ontology evolution, repairing inconsistencies, reasoning in the presence of inconsistencies.
In this paper we survey four different approaches to handling consistent ontology evolution, repairing inconsistencies, reasoning in the presence of multi-version reasoning.
In this paper we survey four different approaches to handling inconsistency in DL-based ontologies , repairing inconsistencies, reasoning in the presence of multi-version reasoning.
In this paper we survey four different approaches to handling inconsistency in DL-based ontologies , repairing inconsistencies, reasoning in the presence of inconsistencies.
We use this common basis to compare these approaches.
We present a common formal basis for all of them.
We discuss the conditions.
We discuss the different requirements for each of these methods.
the conditions under which each of these methods is applicable.
We discuss the different usage scenarios to which these methods would apply.
We discuss the knowledge requirements of the various methods.
