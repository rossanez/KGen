In this paper, we investigate the ( in ) dependence among OWL documents with respect to the logical consequence when OWL documents with respect are combined, in particular the inference of role assertions about individuals.

those documents that affect the inference of a given fact.
On the one hand, we present a systematic approach to identifying those documents.
On the other hand, we consider ways for fast detection of independence.
several special cases in which two documents are independent of each other.
First, we demonstrate several special cases.
Secondly, we introduce an algorithm for checking the independence in the general case.
In addition, we describe two applications.
two applications in which the above results have allowed we to develop novel approaches to overcome some difficulties in reasoning with large scale OWL data.
