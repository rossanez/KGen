In this article, we propose a new ontology evolution approach.
a new ontology evolution approach that combines a an automatic change detection mechanism approach.
a new ontology evolution approach that combines a changes.
This means that the manual request for changes by the ontology engineer is complemented with an automatic change detection mechanism.
a new ontology evolution approach that combines a changes.
a an automatic change detection mechanism approach is based on keeping track of the different versions of ontology concepts throughout track of the different versions of ontology concepts lifetime ( called virtual versions ).
a new ontology evolution approach is based on keeping track of the different versions of ontology concepts throughout track of the different versions of ontology concepts lifetime ( called virtual versions ).
In this way, changes can be defined in terms of these virtual versions.
