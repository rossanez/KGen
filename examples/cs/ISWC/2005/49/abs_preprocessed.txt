In many practical applications, ontologies tend to be very large and complicated.
In order for users to quickly analyze large-scale ontologies, in this paper we propose a novel ontology visualization approach.
In order for users to quickly understand large-scale ontologies, in this paper we propose a novel ontology visualization approach.
a novel ontology visualization approach which aims to complement existing approaches like the hierarchy graph.
Specifically, we approach produces a holistic “ imaging ” of the ontology.
the ontology which contains a semantic layout of the ontology classes.
In addition, the distributions of the ontology instances are also depicted in the “ imaging ”.
In addition, the distributions of instance relations are also depicted in the “ imaging ”.
the key techniques and algorithms used in we approach.
we introduce at length the key techniques and algorithms.
Then we examine the resulting user interface and find the resulting user interface facilitates tasks like ontology retrieval.
Then we examine the resulting user interface and find the resulting user interface facilitates tasks like ontology navigation.
Then we examine the resulting user interface and find the resulting user interface facilitates tasks like ontology instance analysis.
